# Print Resizer - Figma plugin

This plugin collects all components from frames in the current figma page and then copies and rearagndles them into new printable frames. The printable frames can then be exported and printed on regular letter head. This plugin is especially helpful for 
frames with autolayout since they can only scale in only one direction, making printing difficult.

## How this plugin works

When triggered this plugin creates new printable frames from the old frames on the current page.

For example

### If you had this auto layout frame

**Before:** 

![auto-layout](images/auto-layout.png?raw=true) 

**After:** 

![resized](images/resized.png?raw=true)

### Combine Multiple Frames into Printable Pages

**Before:** 

![multi frame](images/multi-frame.png?raw=true) 

**After:** 

![combined frame](images/combined-frame.png?raw=true)
