# Print Resizer - Figma plugin

This plugin collects all components in a pages frames and rearanges them in new printable frame. This is especially helpful for 
frames with autolayout which can scale in only one direction, making printing difficult.

## How this plugin works

When triggered this plugin creates new printable frames from the old frames on the current page.

For example

### If you had this auto layout frame

**Before:** 

![small before](images/auto-layout.png?raw=true) 

**After:** 

![small after](images/resized.png?raw=true)
